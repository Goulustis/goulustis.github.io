I'm a recent graduated masters student from the [University of British Columbia](https://vision.cs.ubc.ca/) supervised by Prof. [Kwang Moo Yi](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~kmyi/) with a focus on combining [Event camera](https://www.prophesee.ai/event-based-sensor-imx646-sony-prophesee/) data with RGB images to create [neural fields](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf).

Now that I have graduated, I spend all my time thinking how I can do nothing and money come to me. I tried:
- Crypto `--` Lost big bucks
- Wav/mp4 to Midi `--` Maybe going somewhere
- Writing chatbot for UBC `--` Maybe going somewhere
- Multiview Wire Art `--` Looks pretty good

I'm open to any crazy ideas anyone has. Just YANK me an email!
